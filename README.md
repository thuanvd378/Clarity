# 🏅 FitStake — On-Chain Fitness Challenge

## 📜 Project Description

**FitStake** is a decentralized, on-chain platform for creating, joining, and verifying fitness challenges (workouts, running, gym, etc.) built with the Clarity smart contract language and deployed on the **Stacks Testnet**.  
Anyone can launch a fitness challenge with a description, timeframe, STX stake, reward pool, and list of verifiers. Challenges only go live after moderator approval.  
Participants stake STX to join and must submit daily proof of their activity. Verifiers confirm each proof on-chain. Successful participants reclaim their stake and split the reward; failed or incomplete attempts result in forfeited stakes to the challenge creator.  
All challenge data, submissions, and results are transparently recorded on the blockchain—no central server required.

## 🔭 Project Vision

FitStake aims to **motivate healthy competition and honest fitness progress** using trustless blockchain technology. By handling all rules, proof validation, and STX flows on-chain, we strive to:

- Encourage commitment and transparency in fitness goals.
- Show how Clarity smart contracts can power real-world social challenges.
- Inspire a wave of gamified, accountable community activity on Stacks and Web3.
